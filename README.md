# Blog Web Application

After learning about RESTful architecture and the CRUD cycle, I created a blog web application. This app is developed using both Front End and Back End stacks, as listed below.

| Front End        | Back End           |
| :-----------:|:-------------:|
| HTML5        | NodeJS / NPM  |
| CSS3         | Express |
| JavaScript / jQuery  | MongoDB |
| Bootstrap 4  |   |

- ✏ Persistent NoSQL(MongoDB) database used to store blog entries.

- 📦 Several NPM packages included

- 🔐 Authentication provided by -- Passport
